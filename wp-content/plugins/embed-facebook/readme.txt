Embed Facebook photo albums in WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you embed Facebook photo albums in WordPress.

Simply paste the URL of a Facebook album in a post or page, the plugin takes care of the rest. It's like magic. (Note: this only works for the albums uploaded by/in a Facebook Page.)
